# Heroku Error Pages
These error pages have the Heroku logo removed and the message trimmed for standard users. These are also formatted decently.

## Files
* `application-error.html`
	* Title: `Application Error`
	* Message: `An error occurred in the application and the page could not be served. Please contact the website administrator.`
