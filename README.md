# Heroku Error Pages
These error pages have the Heroku logo removed and the message trimmed for standard users. These are also formatted decently.

## Files
* [`application-error.html`](http://hkamran80.github.io/heroku-error-pages/application-error.html)
	* Title: `Application Error`
	* Message: `An error occurred in the application and the page could not be served. Please contact the website administrator.`
	* Notes:
		* Still has the Heroku favicon. If anyone has a good error-page favicon, please add it!
